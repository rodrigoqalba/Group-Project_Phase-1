random drinks API: "https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/random.php"

API Info: https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php?ref=apilist.fun

What we will do with that API:

Project Requirements
--Your app must be a HTML/CSS/JS frontend that accesses data from a public API. All interactions between the client and the API should be handled asynchronously and use JSON as the communication format.

-Your entire app must run on a single page. There should be NO redirects. In other words, your project will contain a single HTML file.

-Your app needs to incorporate at least 3 separate event listeners (DOMContentLoaded, click, change, submit, etc).

-Some interactivity is required. This could be as simple as adding a "like" button or adding comments. These interactions do not need to persist after reloading the page.

-Follow good coding practices. Keep your code DRY (Do not repeat yourself) by utilizing functions to abstract repetitive code.

Project Name: "Pick Your Poison"

MVP:

-Plan out your features
    -on page load, show a string of random images on a menu
    -Surprise Me drinks, random drink generator button
    -Show drink information
        -image, name, ingridients, measurements, glass type, instructions, id
    -favorite/like button
    -Use a form to create a new drink
-Develop user stories
-“As [ a user ], I want [ to be able to be returned a random drink when I click on "surprise me", I want to see a menu showcasing random drink, I want to be able to like drinks(stretch goal: save them under a favorites menu) ] so that [ I can figure out what I am going to drink tonight ].”
-Features should not need you there to explain them to users

Strectch Goal:

-creating a favorites menu, where our likes drinks will be added to 
-add music 
-look good (CSS)
-add scroll to images/carousel
